# Hello, World!

My name is Carlos, and I am a Security Researcher focused on Windows exploitation and Intel architecture, particularly low-level concepts.

My objective with this blog is to explain complex concepts from scratch, dissecting them as thoroughly as possible. This way, you won't find yourself in the typical situation of wondering, "When did he explain this?" While it's impossible to cover every single detail, there are some prerequisites. However, I will strive to explain the theory as clearly as I can, making the practical parts easier for everyone.

## Topics Covered

- **Windows Kernel Exploits**: An overview of recent exploits and how they impact system security.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Detailed analysis of known vulnerabilities within the Windows kernel.
- **Intel Processor Architecture**: Understanding the evolution and features of Intel's microarchitectures.

I will be publishing blogs every two weeks. If you have any questions about the content or specific topics, feel free to DM me on Twitter (X)!

I hope we can navigate these difficult topics together and learn new things with each post.
